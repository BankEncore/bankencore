# ADR 0033: Deprecate `value_masked` column

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-10-01

## Context
`value_masked` exists but is no longer authoritative after ADR 0030.

## Decision
Keep short-term for compatibility. Remove after all consumers use `masked_formatted`.

## Consequences
- Temporary redundancy only during transition.

## Implementation
- Method shim: `def value_masked = masked_formatted`.
- Follow-up migration to drop column after verification.

## Rollout
- Search usages and update.  
- Remove within one release cycle post-cutover.
